# Covid-19-Recovery-Rate

### I have made this project to show the recovery rate of people of each state in India from COVID-19.

### You must have a basic knowledge about Numpy and Pandas. 


### You must install the following :-

1) `! pip3 install numpy` 
2) `! pip3 install pandas`
3) `! pip3 install bar_chart_race`
4) `! pip3 install ffmpeg`

### I have included the `covid_19_india.csv` file which I have used in this project.
